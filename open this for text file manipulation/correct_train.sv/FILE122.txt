Design of new β type titanium alloys composed of non-toxic elements like Nb, Ta, Zr, Mo or Sn with lower moduli of elasticity and greater strength were, therefore, studied based on the d-electron alloy design method, and the basic mechanical properties of designed alloys of button ingots melted by tri-arc furnace in the laboratory were investigated in this study.
