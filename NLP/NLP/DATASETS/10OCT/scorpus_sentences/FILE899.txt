Focusing on such an equation of state for LiF, which is a unique crystal possessing the largest reported band gap of any material, here we show that a thermodynamical model, termed cBΩ model, satisfactorily describes the way that the point defect parameters, for various defect processes, are interrelated with bulk properties of the matrix material
