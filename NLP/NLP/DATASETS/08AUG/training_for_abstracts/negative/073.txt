Onsager first explained the tendency of highly anisotropic rod-like and plate-like particles (for example, tobacco mosaic virus and clay particles in solution) to form orientationally ordered nematic phases, and his pioneering work has since been refined into a rich and technologically significant theory of liquid-crystalline material properties and phase transitions.
